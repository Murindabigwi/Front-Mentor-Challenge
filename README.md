## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Bootsrap 4


### What I learned

I still need to put more effort in planning ahead and figure out where I will start from, and how to proceed. Like start with the Html as the back bone and put in the css later
which makes the flow of the project alot more cohherent and easy I believe. I am still new to this so am still learning.


### Continued development

Am still a beginner so the road a head is still long. I stil have a lot to cover.
